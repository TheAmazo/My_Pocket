### Version 4.0.0 APK

The version 4 GitHub release includes a test-installable APK:

```text
MyPocket-v4.0.0-debug.apk
```

Download it from [My Pocket v4.0.0](https://github.com/TheAmazo/My_Pocket/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

SHA-256:

```text
8709e935a8beb588409504828d155b6311d8dd8055350ad7ce2d513e6e904e1e
```

This APK is debug-signed for version 4 testing. A production APK should be signed with a private release keystore that stays outside Git.

### What Is New In v4.0.0

- Pockets can now have an optional Monthly or Lifetime target amount, or stay flexible with no target.
- Target pockets create and trim open savings cards around the remaining amount while saved history stays safe.
- Cleaned up light and dark glass cards to remove ghost shadows and square artifacts.
- Firestore rules now accept the new target fields and tolerate older board totals during safe owner-only refreshes.
- Open savings cards now get fresh lower-biased random values once per day, while saved and locked history stays unchanged.
- Android system back now follows in-app navigation on supported screens.
- Reminder time now opens a clock picker and requests notification permission when needed.
- A refined iOS-inspired black glass dark theme with white-blend glass cards.
- A unified Savings logo across launcher, onboarding, pocket picker, and README.
- Pocket creation now captures both pocket name and purpose.
- Pocket headers now show the selected pocket name instead of a repeated app title.
- Summary is cleaner with one yearly saved card above monthly history.
- Daily reminders support both hour and minute settings.
- Theme settings now support System, Light, and Dark.
- Google sign-in error 10 now explains the Firebase SHA fingerprint fix clearly.

## Why My Pocket?

My Pocket replaces manual savings sheets with a focused Android app. Each pocket can have its own purpose and optional target, every month gets a clean savings board, and the app keeps saved totals, remaining amounts, yearly progress, and reminders in sync without messy marks or wrong calculations.

## Run Locally

### Requirements

- Android Studio Ladybug or newer
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 36
- Firebase project `my-pocket-a381c`
- Local `app/google-services.json`

### Android Studio

Open the full project folder:

```text
/Users/thisara/Desktop/My_Pocket
```

Then:

1. Wait for Gradle Sync.
2. Select the `app` run configuration.
3. Select an emulator or Android phone.
4. Press Run.

Do not open only the `app` folder. Android Studio needs the root Gradle files.

### Terminal Checks

```bash
./gradlew test assembleDebug
./gradlew lintDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

---

## Firebase Setup

Firebase project:

```text
my-pocket-a381c
```

Android package:

```text
com.thisara.mypocket
```

Required products:

- Authentication
- Cloud Firestore

Not required:

- Firebase Storage
- Cloud Functions
- Paid Firebase plan

Full setup guide: [docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md](docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md)

---

## Firestore Shape

```text
users/{uid}
pockets/{pocketId}
pockets/{pocketId}/months/{monthKey}
pockets/{pocketId}/months/{monthKey}/cells/{cellId}
```

Pocket documents include the owner, display name, and purpose:

```text
pockets/{pocketId}.name
pockets/{pocketId}.purpose
pockets/{pocketId}.createdBy
```

Profile avatars are stored as small compressed Base64 data strings:

```text
users/{uid}.photoData
```

This keeps the app compatible with Firebase Spark plan.

---
